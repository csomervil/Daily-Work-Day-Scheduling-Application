# Daily-Work-Day-Scheduling-Application

# Introduction

The Daily Work Day Scheduling Application is a page made in Javascript (jQuery), HTML and CSS. The page has multiple textboxes with save buttons that save inputs into local storage. Using Moment.js, the webpage displays the current time and changes the colours of each textbox depending on if they are in the present (red) future (green) or past (grey).
